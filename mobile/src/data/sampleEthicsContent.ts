# Federal Ethics Basics

## Overview
Federal employees are held to the highest standards of ethical conduct. This module covers the fundamental principles that guide ethical behavior in the federal workplace.

## Key Principles

### 1. Public Service is a Public Trust
Every federal employee has a responsibility to use public resources only for authorized activities. This includes:
- Using government time and equipment only for official duties
- Avoiding conflicts between personal and professional interests
- Maintaining confidentiality of non-public information

### 2. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest
Federal employees must avoid situations where personal interests could compromise their professional judgment.

#### Examples of Conflicts:
- **Financial Interest**: Owning stock in a company regulated by EPA
- **Personal Relationships**: Supervising a family member
- **Outside Employment**: Working for entities regulated by EPA

### 3. Impartiality in Performance of Official Duties
All citizens deserve fair and equal treatment from government employees.

## 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101 - Basic Obligation of Public Service

*"Each employee has a responsibility to the United States Government and its citizens to place loyalty to the Constitution, laws and ethical principles above private gain."*

### The 14 Principles of Ethical Conduct:

1. Public service is a public trust
2. Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty
3. Employees shall not engage in financial transactions using nonpublic government information
4. An employee shall not solicit or accept any gift which may reasonably be construed to influence the employee
5. Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties
6. Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises
7. Employees shall not use public office for private gain
8. Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment
9. Employees shall protect and conserve Federal property
10. Employees shall not engage in outside employment incompatible with government duties
11. Employees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption
12. Employees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens
13. Employees shall adhere to all laws and regulations
14. Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance of violating these principles

## EPA-Specific Considerations

As an EPA employee, you have additional responsibilities:
- Protecting environmental information
- Maintaining scientific integrity
- Ensuring fair enforcement of environmental laws

## Key Takeaways
- Ethics rules exist to maintain public trust
- When in doubt, ask your ethics office
- Prevention is better than remediation
- Consider both actual and apparent conflicts

# Conflict of Interest

## What is a Conflict of Interest?

A conflict of interest occurs when a federal employee's personal interests could improperly influence their professional judgment or actions.

## Types of Conflicts

### Financial Conflicts (5 C.F.R. § 2635.401-403)

#### Prohibited Financial Interests:
- **Direct ownership** in companies regulated by EPA
- **Mutual funds** that include prohibited holdings
- **Partnerships** with regulated entities

#### Example Scenario:
*Sarah works in EPA's air quality division and owns stock in a major automotive manufacturer. When her division reviews emissions standards that will affect this company, she has a financial conflict of interest.*

### Personal Relationship Conflicts (5 C.F.R. § 2635.502)

#### Covered Relationships Include:
- Spouse and minor children
- General partners
- Employers of family members
- Organizations where you serve as officer/director

#### Example Scenario:
*John's spouse works for an environmental consulting firm. John cannot participate in EPA decisions that would specifically affect his spouse's employer.*

### Political Activity Conflicts (Hatch Act)

Federal employees are restricted in political activities during work hours:
- Cannot campaign for candidates while on duty
- Cannot use government resources for political purposes
- Cannot solicit political contributions

## Recusal and Mitigation

### When to Recuse:
1. **Identify** the potential conflict
2. **Notify** your supervisor immediately
3. **Document** the recusal in writing
4. **Avoid** all involvement in the matter

### Waivers and Authorizations:
Some conflicts can be resolved through:
- Qualified diversified trusts
- Certificates of Divestiture
- Individual waivers (rare)

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: Stock Ownership
*EPA scientist Dr. Martinez inherited stock in a chemical company. When assigned to review that company's pesticide application, she properly recused herself and sold the stock.*

### Case Study 2: Outside Employment
*EPA attorney wanted to teach environmental law part-time. He obtained proper approval from the ethics office before beginning the position.*

### Case Study 3: Board Service
*Senior EPA official was asked to serve on a nonprofit environmental board. She declined after learning the organization frequently lobbies EPA.*

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review financial holdings
2. **Disclosure**: Keep ethics office informed of changes
3. **Documentation**: Maintain records of recusals
4. **Training**: Stay current on ethics requirements

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- Could this decision affect my financial interests?
- Would a reasonable person question my impartiality?
- Do I have a personal relationship with someone affected?
- Am I using my position for personal benefit?

**Remember: When in doubt, ask your ethics office!**

# Gifts and Travel Restrictions

## Gift Rules Overview (5 C.F.R. § 2635.201-205)

Federal employees generally cannot accept gifts from prohibited sources or given because of their official position.

## The $20 Rule

### Basic Gift Limit:
- **$20 per source per occasion**
- **$50 aggregate per source per year**

### What Counts as a Gift:
- Meals and refreshments
- Transportation and lodging
- Entertainment tickets
- Promotional items
- Services provided at reduced cost

## Prohibited Sources

You cannot accept gifts from:
1. **Persons seeking official action** from EPA
2. **Persons doing business** with EPA
3. **Persons whose interests** may be substantially affected by your official duties
4. **Associations/organizations** representing such persons

### Examples:
- Environmental consulting firms
- Companies with EPA permits
- Industry trade associations
- Environmental advocacy groups (if they lobby EPA)

## Exceptions and Safe Harbors

### Widely Attended Gatherings (WAG)
May accept free attendance if:
- Event includes 100+ attendees
- Education/discussion relates to your duties
- EPA has an interest in your attendance
- Prior approval obtained

### Other Exceptions:
- **Personal hospitality** at private residences
- **Gifts of nominal value** ($10 or less)
- **Gifts based on personal relationships**
- **Free attendance** at speaking events where you're speaking

## Travel Rules (5 C.F.R. § 2635.204)

### General Prohibition:
Cannot accept travel payments from prohibited sources.

### Exceptions Include:
- **Universities and think tanks** (for speaking/teaching)
- **State and local governments**
- **Foreign governments** (with approval)
- **501(c)(3) organizations** (case-by-case basis)

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Conference Lunch
*An environmental consulting firm sponsors lunch at a conference you're attending. The $30 meal exceeds the $20 limit, so you must decline or pay the difference.*

### Scenario 2: Holiday Gift
*A regulated company sends a $40 fruit basket to your office during holidays. This exceeds the gift limit and must be returned or donated to charity.*

### Scenario 3: Personal Friendship
*Your college roommate (now working for an environmental firm) invites you to dinner. This is permitted as personal hospitality based on your friendship.*

### Scenario 4: Industry Reception
*You're invited to an industry reception. If it's a widely attended gathering with educational value and you get approval, you may attend.*

## Travel Approval Process

### Steps Required:
1. **Identify the source** of travel funding
2. **Determine if source is prohibited**
3. **Assess EPA's interest** in your attendance
4. **Obtain written approval** before traveling
5. **Submit travel request** through proper channels

### Documentation Needed:
- Event agenda and attendee list
- Justification for EPA interest
- Estimated costs and source of funding
- Supervisor and ethics office approval

## Gift Handling Procedures

### If You Receive an Improper Gift:

1. **Don't Accept**: Politely decline if possible
2. **Return Promptly**: Send back with explanation
3. **Donate to Charity**: If return isn't practical
4. **Document Actions**: Keep records of how handled
5. **Report to Ethics Office**: Notify ethics officials

### Sample Decline Language:
*"Thank you for thinking of me, but as a federal employee, I cannot accept this gift due to ethics regulations. I hope you understand."*

## Special Considerations

### Gifts to EPA (Not You Personally):
- Gifts to the agency may be acceptable
- Must go through proper channels
- Cannot be for your personal use

### International Travel:
- Foreign government gifts subject to special rules
- Cultural considerations may apply
- Always coordinate with ethics office

### Awards and Honors:
- Professional awards generally acceptable
- Cash prizes usually prohibited
- Plaques and certificates typically OK

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Timing**: Gifts offered during pending decisions
- **Value**: Items that seem unusually expensive
- **Pattern**: Multiple gifts from same source
- **Exclusivity**: Invitations not extended to other EPA staff

## Best Practices

1. **Establish Clear Policies**: With regular contacts
2. **Train Your Staff**: On gift and travel rules
3. **Document Decisions**: Keep records of approvals/denials
4. **Seek Guidance**: Contact ethics office early and often
5. **Lead by Example**: Model appropriate behavior

Remember: The appearance of impropriety can be as damaging as actual misconduct. When in doubt, don't accept!

# Post-Employment Limitations

## Overview (18 U.S.C. § 207)

Post-employment restrictions prevent former federal employees from improperly using their government knowledge and contacts for private gain.

## Lifetime Restrictions

### 18 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1) - Lifetime Ban
Former federal employees are **permanently prohibited** from representing anyone (including themselves) before the federal government on particular matters they worked on personally and substantially while at EPA.

#### Example:
*Former EPA attorney Sarah worked on XYZ Company's permit application. She can never represent any client regarding that specific permit application, even 20 years later.*

## Two-Year Restrictions

### 18 U.S.C. § 207(a)(2) - Two-Year Cooling Off
For **two years** after leaving EPA, former employees cannot represent anyone before EPA on matters that were pending under their official responsibility during their last year of service.

#### Key Points:
- Applies to matters **pending** during last year
- Must have been under your **official responsibility**
- Broader than just matters you personally worked on

#### Example:
*EPA division director Mike oversaw pesticide registrations. For two years after leaving, he cannot represent clients on any pesticide registration matters, even ones he never personally reviewed.*

## One-Year Restrictions

### 18 U.S.C. § 207(c) - Senior Employee Restrictions
**Senior employees** (GS-17 and above, or equivalent) face a **one-year ban** on representing anyone before their former agency on any matter.

#### Who is Covered:
- Senior Executive Service (SES)
- GS-17 and above
- Commissioned officers O-7 and above
- Schedule C employees at equivalent levels

### 18 U.S.C. § 207(d) - Very Senior Employee Restrictions
**Very senior employees** face a **one-year ban** on representing anyone before any federal agency or court on any matter.

#### Who is Covered:
- Employees paid at Executive Level I-V
- Political appointees confirmed by Senate
- Vice President, Cabinet members

## Trade Representative Restrictions

### 18 U.S.C. § 207(b) - Special Rules
Former trade representatives and their staff have unique restrictions on representing foreign entities in trade matters.

## Communication vs. Representation

### What's Prohibited:
- **Formal representation** before EPA
- **Informal advocacy** with intent to influence
- **Strategic advice** on how to approach EPA
- **Behind-the-scenes communications** on behalf of clients

### What's Generally Permitted:
- **General policy discussions** (not specific matters)
- **Educational presentations** to groups
- **Writing articles** on regulatory topics
- **Teaching** about environmental law

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: Lifetime Ban
*Former EPA scientist Dr. Johnson personally reviewed and approved BioTech Inc.'s pesticide registration. After leaving EPA, Dr. Johnson can never work on anything related to that specific registration for any client.*

### Scenario 2: Two-Year Restriction
*Former permits division chief Lisa had 200 permit applications pending in her division when she left EPA. For two years, she cannot represent any client on permit applications before EPA.*

### Scenario 3: One-Year Senior Restriction
*Former Assistant Administrator Brown (SES-level) cannot represent anyone before EPA for one year after leaving, regardless of the subject matter.*

### Scenario 4: Consulting Work
*Former EPA attorney wants to help law firm understand EPA procedures. This general guidance is usually permitted, but advising on specific pending matters would be prohibited.*

## Partnership and Employment Issues

### "Of Counsel" Arrangements:
Even serving as "of counsel" to a firm may trigger restrictions if you're providing prohibited services.

### Partnership Profits:
Partners may be restricted from receiving profits from prohibited representations, even if they don't personally work on the matters.

### Supervision:
Former employees generally cannot supervise others doing work they're prohibited from doing themselves.

## Waivers and Exceptions

### Limited Exceptions:
- **Scientific or technological** matters (narrow exception)
- **International agreements** (case-by-case)
- **Pro bono publico** representations (limited circumstances)

### Waiver Process:
- Very rare and difficult to obtain
- Must show no potential for misuse of position
- Requires high-level approval

## Criminal Penalties

### Violations Can Result In:
- **Up to two years** in federal prison
- **Substantial fines**
- **Criminal record**
- **Professional sanctions** (law license suspension)

### Individual and Entity Liability:
Both the former employee AND the entity they represent can face criminal charges.

## Best Practices for Current Employees

### While Still at EPA:
1. **Keep detailed records** of matters you work on
2. **Understand your responsibilities** for different matters
3. **Get advice early** if considering departure
4. **Plan career transitions** carefully

### When Leaving EPA:
1. **Get written ethics advice** before accepting new position

- **Employment contracts** with specific restrictions

## Staying Compliant

### Regular Review:
- **Annual assessment** of restrictions
- **Updated legal advice** as laws change
- **Client screening** procedures
- **Documentation** of compliance measures

### Warning Signs:
- **Former colleagues** asking for help on EPA matters
- **Clients wanting** EPA-specific advice
- **Opportunities** that seem too closely related to former duties

## Getting Help

### Before You Leave EPA:
- **Ethics office consultation**
- **Written guidance** on specific situations
- **Career transition planning**

### After Leaving EPA:
- **Private ethics counsel**
- **Bar association guidance** (for attorneys)
- **Regular compliance review**

**Remember**: Post-employment restrictions are criminal laws. The consequences of violations are severe. When in doubt, get legal advice!

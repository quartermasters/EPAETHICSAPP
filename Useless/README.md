## ℹ️ Purpose

These files were moved to keep the main project structure clean and focused on production-ready code. The files in this folder include:

1. **Development utilities** that were used during development but aren't needed for deployment
2. **Testing scripts** that are superseded by the main testing workflow
3. **Demo/example files** that were used for prototyping
4. **Duplicate content** from reorganized project structure
5. **Log files** generated during development
6. **Deprecated components** replaced by better implementations

## 🚀 Production Focus

The main project now contains only essential files for:
- ✅ EPA Ethics Mobile App (React Native/Expo)
- ✅ Admin Portal (Next.js)
- ✅ Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- ✅ Federal compliance documentation
- ✅ Deployment configuration

## 🔄 Recovery

If any file from this folder is needed, it can be moved back to the main project structure. All files are preserved and functional.

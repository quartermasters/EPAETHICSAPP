## 10. Conclusion & Next Steps

### Current Status Summary
The EthicsGo application is in early prototype stage with significant gaps across all critical requirement areas. While the foundational UI/UX design shows promise, the current web-based architecture cannot meet EPA's mobile app deployment requirements.

### Critical Decision Points
1. **Timeline Adjustment:** EPA must approve extended timeline (8-12 weeks minimum)
2. **Resource Investment:** St. Michael LLC needs $150,000+ additional investment
3. **Technical Pivot:** Complete rebuild required using React Native framework
4. **Compliance Priority:** FedRAMP and Section 508 compliance must be prioritized

### Success Path Forward
With proper resource allocation, timeline adjustment, and focused compliance implementation, the EthicsGo application can successfully meet all EPA requirements. The key is immediate action on critical gaps and realistic expectations management with EPA stakeholders.

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Schedule EPA stakeholder meeting within 48 hours
2. Present gap analysis and revised project plan
3. Secure approval for extended timeline and budget
4. Begin immediate team expansion and infrastructure planning
